"The game comes with three graphics engines, which can be selected in the "

"one. You can try each to see which one suits your system the best: which one "

msgstr ""

#. TRANSLATORS: shader is the technical term for the small programs running on the video card,

#. to any nice word, which suggests the meaning. or simple leave it there like "shader" in
#. quotation marks, as the explanation is there in the next sentence, and users will know what

"The OpenGL engine can use hardware acceleration and it can synchronize the "
"scrolling to the refresh rate of your monitor. However, if your computer or "
"video hardware driver does not support OpenGL, it may be slow. This engine "
"can use shaders, which are small programs running on the video hardware (if "
"your graphics card supports it), adding various visual effects like TV "
"screen distortion or PAL emulation."

"If the game runs slow, you can try turning off fine scrolling or particle "

"The game also supports themes. You can use the installed PNG file as a "

"transparent layer in some graphics editors). If the image has only a small "
"number of colors (fully saturated red for foreground color 1, fully "
"saturated green for amoeba...), the game will use original C64 colors, "
"different ones for every cave. Whether the png file is interpreted as a true "
"color image or one with C64 colors, depends on the color values used, and is "
"autodetected. An image file with only #000000, #00FF00 and the like is taken "
"as a C64 theme.\n"
"For C64 themes, the meaning of colors are these:\n"
"- Transparent: you should use it everywhere where there is no drawing.\n"
"- Black #000000: background color.\n"
